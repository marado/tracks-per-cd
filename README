This is a very very hackish and ugly script I've just made to prove a point on
a G+ comment.
But *please do* use, abuse, and specially make it better ;-)

script.sh is *the* script, the rest are only the generated files from my
run (from where I extracted the result I'm using on that G+ comment ;-)). 

This script tries to estimate how many tracks are there (medium) in one audio
CD released in 2011.
